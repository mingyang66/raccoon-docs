###### 401 Content access is protected by token

```sh
This error message indicates that you are likely publishing to OSSRH via your username and 
password. While this was a previously allowed way of interacting with OSSRH, changes to the 
authentication process have resulted in publishing requiring the use of a user token. We have 
documentation on setting up a user token that will help.
```
